Cost & Licensing


Rancher is fully open-source and free
OpenShift requires Red Hat subscription licenses
Rancher's cost advantage makes it more accessible for small to medium businesses


Flexibility & Vendor Lock-in


Rancher works with any CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution
Rancher supports multiple cloud providers seamlessly
OpenShift is more tightly coupled to Red Hat's ecosystem
Rancher allows easier migration between different infrastructure providers


Resource Requirements


Rancher has lower minimum system requirements
OpenShift needs more CPU/RAM for its base installation
Rancher can run effectively on smaller clusters


Learning Curve


Rancher stays closer to vanilla Kubernetes
OpenShift introduces many custom abstractions and concepts
Rancher's UI is more intuitive for Kubernetes natives
Knowledge transfer from Rancher to other K8s tools is easier


Installation & Maintenance


Rancher has a simpler installation process
RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine) is lightweight and easy to set up
OpenShift installations are more complex and time-consuming
Rancher updates are less disruptive to running workloads


CI/CD Integration


Rancher integrates easily with existing CI/CD tools
OpenShift pushes towards its own build configs and pipelines
Rancher allows more flexibility in tooling choices


Multi-cluster Management


Rancher excels at managing multiple clusters across different providers
Built-in support for importing existing clusters
More straightforward cluster lifecycle management
Better suited for hybrid and multi-cloud strategies


Community & Support


Active open-source community
Regular community-driven updates
Documentation is more accessible
Lower barrier to entry for community contributions


Security Features


Built-in integration with common authentication providers
Project-level security policies
Fine-grained RBAC controls
Less complex security setup compared to OpenShift


Development Experience


More familiar to developers who know Kubernetes
Less abstraction between developer and infrastructure
Easier local development setup
Better compatibility with standard Kubernetes tools and practices


Out of these reasons I would go with Rancher.
